_Smash them keys_

Smashie is a small experiment that I created to teach core concepts of SDL (and SDL wrapper) programming to classmates (aka love2d using lua).
The aim of the game is to survive the longest by typing the keys shown on descending blocks before they go off the screen. The more mistakes they make, the smaller the zone in which they can trigger the blocks becomes. Once it reaches zero size it resets and an extra block is introduced.

To run, open with love2d.

_Todo: add compiled version_
